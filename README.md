PROJECT WRITE UP

The volume lamp translates the noise of the environment it inhabits into motion, intensity, and color. The goal is to visually reflect noise of a space giving people another way to interpret and value an often overlooked sense. 

I acheived this effect though the use of an arduino uno, LED strip, adafruit mic, and a code. In the code I made a range of the volume info from the mic and segregated it into loud and normal. When sound is normal the lights are blue soft and bounce quietly... When higher volume levels are detected more lights turn on and the change color from blue to green to yellow. The smooth transition between the intensity and color of lights is accomplished through the incorporation of a float function.
